It was founded in Berlin in 2013 by Osnat Michaeli and the brothers Guy and Erez Galonska, who turned a 1955 Airstream trailer into the world's first mobile vertical farm. From this humble beginning, Infarm has since partnered with more than 30 of the world's top retail chains and is available in more than 1850 stores worldwide, servicing more than 2 million customers in 11 countries.Infarm is the world's fastest-growing vertical farming company. By 2030, 20 countries in NA, Asia and the Middle East will enjoy Infarm's fresh, highly nutritious, chemical pesticide-free, locally-grown produce year-round, without fluctuation in quality or pricing. The company's state-of-the-art farming systems are highly efficient, capable of growing more than 500,000 plants annually on just 40m2 of floor space. On top of using 95% less land, Infarm's farming methods require 95% less water than traditional farming methods. So far, Infarm has saved more than 136 million litres of water, 180,000m2 of land, and nearly three million food kilometres. Infarm is the first vertical farming company that has committed to setting a science-based net-zero carbon target through The Science Based Targets initiative.","location":"üìçBerlin,
