This results in a highly fragmented and inefficient supply chain, high costs, unacceptable turnaround times, and quality issues. Using highly qualified internal resources to translate or create multilingual content (insourcing) solves the quality problem for enterprises, but if done manually, it can't solve for scalability, high cost, and slow turnaround.\nSmartcat changes the ROI equation in favor of insourcing with its Language AI platform for enterprise end-users. It delivers high-quality, instantaneous AI translations or generates new content in any language by tapping into a customer-specific multilingual content library. The AI output is further refined through human editing by the client's internal reviewers or experts from the Smartcat's embedded global marketplace of linguists and content editors. This AI output continuously improves through the editing feedback loop, ensuring consistent and customer-tailored results.\nMore than 1,000 global companies including ~20% of the Fortune 1,000 trust Smartcat to communicate their innovations and ideas all over the world.\nAs a dynamic Series C company, Smartcat is growing at 130% YoY, thanks to the high and quick ROI it delivers to global enterprises.
